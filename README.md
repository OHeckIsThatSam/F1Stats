# F1Stats

A C# console application for viewing and querying the results of the F1 2022 season created for a university module in my second year. 
The application uses Microsoft Sequel Server as the database and Entity Framework Core as an ORM.  

I used this project to explore the C# LINQ library and recursion in the form of the recursive menu system implemented as the user interface.
